          <h1 id="ttle">AVENGERS</h1>
          <p id="txt">The Avengers are an all star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from the Marvel Comics portfolio. Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle especially formidable villains. This in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as the X Men, whose characters were created specifically to be part of their team, with the team being central to their identity. The Avengers were created to raise book sales and cross promote Marvel Comics characters. An Iron Man fan might buy an Avengers book because Iron Man appears in them, and perhaps in turn take an interest in Thor, who appears in the same book as Iron Man's friend and comrade.[2] The cast usually features a few highly popular characters who have their own solo books, such as Iron Man, alongside a number of lesser known characters who benefit from exposure, such as Quicksilver.[3</p>
